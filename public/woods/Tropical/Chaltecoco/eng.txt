Caesalpinia velutina
This is a beautiful orange wood native to Guatemala, closely related to Brazilwood and Chakte Viga, known for its vibrant color, fine texture, and durability. 
Chaltecoco wood has a bright orange heartwood that darkens with time to an orange-red, with a high luster and fine texture.
Itâ€™s a strong and durable wood suitable for turnery, furniture, flooring, and even guitar components, due to its similarity to Brazilwood, a wood prized for violin.
