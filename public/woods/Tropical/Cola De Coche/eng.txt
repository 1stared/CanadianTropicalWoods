Pithecolobium arborium
The wood is yellowing grey in the sapwood, merging to banded red brown and gold brown heartwood. 
The grain is coarse with a ribbon figure, texture is medium, and pores rather large. 
It weighs 45 lbs. cu. ft. It is 10% to 15% harder than mahogany. Shrinkage is moderate. 
It seasons well with little splitting and distortion. 
It is resistant to fungus and insect attack. 
It works fairly well, but sharp tools are necessary to prevent picking up of grain. 
It is probably not suitable for rotary peeling but would make good decorative veneer if sliced. 
Otherwise it could be used for most utility and constructional purposes and would make good furniture.
