Metopium broweni
Chechen, also known as Black Poisonwood or Caribbean Rosewood, is a dense, durable hardwood native from MesoAmerica, prized for its striking color and grain, and used in furniture, flooring, and more. 
Chechen wood exhibits a rich color palette, ranging from golden brown to deep reddish-brown, often with dark streaks and a dramatic, swirling grain. The grain is typically straight or interlocked, and can have a two-toned appearance, similar to true rosewood.
It's a dense, durable, and naturally rot-resistant wood. 
Chechen is relatively easy to work with despite its hardness, and it sands and finishes to a high polish.
