Vatairea lundelli
The wood is bright yellow when freshly sawn and mellows into a brown with red, yellow or olive hues as it dries sometimes with pink veins. It’s a dense timber at 750 kg/m2 with clearly demarcated sapwood and a straight or interlocked grain. It has a coarse texture.
Danto’s heartwood is quite durable and stable. Due to a moderate susceptibility to fungi and dry wood borers, treatment is recommended.
Danto is used for high-class furniture, stairs, paneling, fine and industrial flooring, formwork and sliced veneer. It can be used for exteriors, including tables, pergolas, benches, and decking. Construction uses include frames, rails, skirting boards, treads and others requiring medium to high weight-bearing strength.
