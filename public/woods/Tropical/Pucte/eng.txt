Bucida Buceras
Pucte is a durable hardwood that showcases a beautiful range of colors, from yellowish to greenish brown, often accompanied by an olive hue. Its unique interwoven grain patterns can create striking longitudinal stripes, adding character to the wood.
This versatile wood is ideal for various applications, including heavy-duty and residential flooring, furniture, interior trim, and decking. Additionally, its robust nature makes it a valuable choice for marine construction projects, such as ship keels and bridges, particularly in environments where bores are not present.
