Ramon Blanco (Brosimun allicastrum)
Color/Appearance: Heartwood and sapwood are both a pale yellow to light brown and are indistinguishable from each other. Another variety called ramon colorado can have a darker orangish brown false heartwood, often with darker streaks (frequency and extent of this coloration depends on growing conditions and age of tree). Sapwood is prone to fungal staining if not dried properly.
Grain/Texture: Grain is usually straight, or irregular and shallowly interlocked, with a medium to fine texture. Moderate to high natural luster.
Rot Resistance: Non-durable; poor resistance to decay or insect attack.
Can be difficult to work with hand tools on account of its grain and densityâ€”as well as a reported silica content of .68%, which can prematurely dull cutters. Irregular or interlocked grain can pose a challenge when machining, otherwise it has good machinability in straight-grained material. Glues, stains, and finishes well.
