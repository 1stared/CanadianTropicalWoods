Granadillo (Platymiscium Yucatatum)
Granadillo is a dense, fine-textured, tropical hardwood known for its reddish-brown to orange hues and darker streaks, often used for both veneers and lumber, and sometimes referred to as Macacauba or Mexican Rosewood. 
Granadillo is used for both veneers and lumber, and can be figured. It's also commonly used in South America for instrument building.
While not a true rosewood, it shares some similarities with Cocobolo, particularly in its appearance and density. However, Granadillo is easier to work with and glues more readily.
